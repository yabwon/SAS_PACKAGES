# SAS_PACKAGES - a SAS Packages Framework

---

A **SAS package** is an automatically generated, single, stand alone *zip* file containing organised and ordered code structures, created by the developer and extended with additional automatically generated "driving" files (i.e. description, metadata, load, unload, and help files). 

The *purpose of a package* is to be a simple, and easy to access, code sharing medium, which will allow: on the one hand, to separate the code complex dependencies created by the developer from the user experience with the final product and, on the other hand, reduce developer's and user's unnecessary frustration related to a remote deployment process.

In this repository we are presenting the **SAS Packages Framework** which allows to develop and use SAS packages. 

Don't forget to give the repository a **STAR** and become [stargazer](https://github.com/yabwon/SAS_PACKAGES/stargazers)! :-)

### Initiative to add SAS Packages Framework to SAS Base/Viya:

A **SASware Ballot Idea** for adding *SAS Packages Framework* macros into Base SAS and Viya was submitted Friday, May 27th 2022. If you would like to support the idea visit this [**communities.sas.com post**](https://communities.sas.com/t5/SASware-Ballot-Ideas/Add-SAS-Packages-Framework-to-the-SAS-Base-Viya/idi-p/815508) and up vote the idea! We have 46 likes from 44 supporters up to today (as of April 22, 2025)!

### A Brief User Manual:

This is a brief intro. See below to find a link to detailed workshop materials.

#### Create directory 

The first step to use a package with the SAS Packages Framework:

- Create a folder for your packages, under Windows OS family e.g., `C:/SAS_PACKAGES` or under Linux/UNIX OS family e.g., `/home/<username>/SAS_PACKAGES`. The path selected is totally up to you.

#### Manual installation 

- Manually download the `SPFinit.sas` file (the SAS Packages Framework) into the local packages folder.
- \[Optional\] Manually download the `<packageName>.zip` file into the local packages folder.
- and Execute:

```sas
filename packages "<directory/containing/packages/>";         /* setup directory for packages */
%include packages(SPFinit.sas);                               /* enable the framework */

/* %installPackage(packageName) */                            /* install the package, unless you downloaded it manually */

%helpPackage(packageName)                                     /* get help about the package */
%loadPackage(packageName)                                     /* load the package content into the SAS session */
```

---

#### Automatic (one-time-only) installation 

If you need it just for "one time" only, e.g., for test if you like it:

- Execute: 

```sas
filename packages "%sysfunc(pathname(work))"; /* setup WORK as temporary directory for packages */
filename SPFinit url "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yabwon/SAS_PACKAGES/main/SPF/SPFinit.sas";
%include SPFinit; /* enable the framework */

%installPackage(packageName) /* install a package */
%helpPackage(packageName)    /* get help about the package */
%loadPackage(packageName)    /* load the package content into the SAS session */
```

---

#### Automatic (permanent) installation

To install SPF pragmatically:

- Enable the framework [do this first and one time only!]:

```sas
filename SPFinit url "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yabwon/SAS_PACKAGES/main/SPF/SPFinit.sas";
%include SPFinit; /* enable the framework */
```

  or (shorter) with:

```sas
filename SPFinit url "https://bit.ly/SPFinit";
%include SPFinit; /* enable the framework */
```

- Install the framework on your machine in the folder you created:

```sas
filename packages "<directory/containing/packages/>"; 
%installPackage(SPFinit) /* install the framework */
```

- From now on, just like you would assign libraries, run the SPF and use packages like this:

```sas
filename packages "<directory/containing/packages/>";
%include packages(SPFinit.sas);

%installPackage(packageName) /* install a package */
%helpPackage(packageName)    /* get help about the package */
%loadPackage(packageName)    /* load the package content into the SAS session */
```

The youtube "Workshop video for the User" got outdated (in general). Newer version is coming soon, in the mean time see some of the videos from the "Recordings and Presentations" section above. 
(You can watch the workshop if you wish, link is working and some parts are still valid source of information e.g., "`ICE` loading" or "`disk` loading")

 <s>[**Workshop video for the User**](https://youtu.be/qX_-HJ76g8Y) \[May 6th, 2020\] [~86 minutes, outdated (installPackage macro was not there yet) but gives the idea how it works especially load, help, unload, ICEload, and other details]</s>

### For The Developer:

In brief, to create your own package:

- Download (and use) the `SPFinit.sas` file (the SAS Packages Framework), the part of the framework required for *testing* is there too.

- See this ["Hello World" example tutorial.](https://github.com/yabwon/SAS_PACKAGES/blob/main/SPF/Documentation/HelloWorldPackage.md "Hello World")

- Read the [**`SAS Packages - The Way to Share (a How-To) - Paper 4725-2020 - extended version`**](https://github.com/yabwon/SAS_PACKAGES/blob/main/SPF/Documentation/SAS(r)%20packages%20-%20the%20way%20to%20share%20(a%20how%20to)-%20Paper%204725-2020%20-%20extended.pdf "SAS packages - the way to share") article to learn more details.

- Read the **`My First SAS Package: A How-To - Paper 1079-2021`** article available at communities.sas.com [**`here`**](https://communities.sas.com/t5/SAS-Global-Forum-Proceedings/My-First-SAS-Package-A-How-To/ta-p/726319 "My First SAS Package: A How-To") or locally [**`here`**](https://github.com/yabwon/SAS_PACKAGES/blob/main/SPF/Documentation/Paper_1079-2021/My%20First%20SAS%20Package%20-%20a%20How%20To.pdf "My First SAS Package: A How-To")

The SAS Packages Framework [(short) documentation](https://github.com/yabwon/SAS_PACKAGES/blob/main/SPF/SPFinit.md) to quickly see macros options and parameters.
